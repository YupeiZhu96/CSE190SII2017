          <p>When you take some beautiful photos, nice songs or funny videoes and upload them to the public websites like Instagram and Youtube, it is very angry to see others plagiarize your works and gain a lot of followers and subscriptions without even mention your name. How to prevent plagiarism? Just don't publish it? You will lose a chance to become famous! If each of your products contains your signature, the viewers will still remember you even if they see it from other sources. However, such signature should not be annoying and should not destroy the viewing experience. Digital watermark is born for this situation. It provides a efficient and simple way to protect people's copyrights. Nowadays, this technique has been applied widely and we can see it everywhere.</p> 
          <p>The basic idea of digital watermarking is to add some staffs to the work and such staff will not damage the main body of the work too much. As a result, the original author can have a &quot;permanent&quot; trace on his works even though anyone steal his works.</p>
